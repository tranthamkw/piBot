piBoard4 is a IO board connecting to the Raspi GPIO port to various devices.  There are six main uses/port extensions.

1. RS485.  All remote sensors and motor/servo controllers are controlled through this bus.
Raspi GPIO pins used: WPi0, UART_Rx, UART_Tx

2. SPI ports. Two CFAF128x128 TFT displays connect to the SPI ports.
Raspi GPIO pints used: MOSI=SPIDAT, SCLK=SPICLK, CE0, CE1

3. General Purpose Digital IO. (later expansion?)
WPi4, WPi4, WPi1, WPi3

4. General purpose I2C port (later expansion?)
SDA1,SCL1,SDA0,SCL0

5. General purpose SPI. Extens the above and adds MISO

6. POWER.  +5, and ground.  Power to the pi is supplied through this board, not the mini usb.
